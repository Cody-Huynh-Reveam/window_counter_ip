# what to commit
the following files will need to be commit if there are changes to them everything else does not have to be commited, can stay on local machine. Tree view is better for this.
* `<project name>.scrcs` folder
* `ip_repo` folder
* `<project name>.xpr`
# useful commands
`git clean -fd`
clear the dir to match the remote repo
# notes
will have to make a new HDL wrapper for the design
